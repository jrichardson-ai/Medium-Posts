Summary -------   In February 2012, pursuant to an SEC order, FINRA established an  accounting support fee (GASB Accounting Support Fee) to adequately  fund the annual budget of the Governmental Accounting Standards  Board (GASB). The GASB Accounting Support Fee is collected on a  quarterly basis from member firms that report trades to the Municipal  Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). Each member firm’s assessment  is based on its portion of the total par value of municipal securities  transactions reported by all FINRA member firms to the MSRB during  the previous quarter. FINRA will assess and collect a total of $17,298,100  to adequately fund GASB’s annual budget by collecting $4,324,525 from  its member firms each calendar quarter beginning in April 2025.  Questions regarding this Notice should be directed to the:    Finance Department at (240) 386-5910; or    Office of General Counsel at (202) 728-8071.  Background & Discussion  Pursuant to Section 14 of Schedule A to FINRA’s By-Laws, which was  adopted in response to the SEC’s 2011 order under Section 19(g) of the  Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),1 FINRA assesses a reasonable  annual accounting support fee to adequately fund the annual budget  of GASB.2 The GASB Accounting Support Fee is assessed on a quarterly  basis and is based on member firms’ municipal securities trading  volume reported to the MSRB during the previous calendar quarter.   Each quarter, FINRA collects one-fourth of the annual GASB Accounting  Support Fee from its member firms. A firm’s quarterly assessment  reflects its portion of the total par value of municipal securities  transactions reported to the MSRB by all FINRA members in the previous 


calendar quarter. To exclude firms with de minimis transactions in municipal  securities in a given quarter from being assessed the fee, firms with a quarterly  assessment of less than $25 are not charged the fee for that quarter, and any  amounts originally assessed to those firms are reallocated among the firms with  an assessment that quarter of $25 or more. Firms that do not engage in reportable  municipal securities transactions during a particular calendar quarter are not subject  to the GASB Accounting Support Fee for that quarter.  For 2025, GASB’s annual budget expenses of $18,897,700 will be partially funded  from $1,599,600 of excess reserves from the Financial Accounting Foundation.  As a result, the recoverable annual budgeted expense for purposes of the GASB  Accounting Support Fee is $17,298,100;3 therefore, FINRA will collect $4,324,525 from  its member firms each quarter beginning in April 2025.4 Because some firms may seek to pass the GASB Accounting Support Fee onto  customers engaged in municipal securities transactions, FINRA will continue to  provide an estimated fee rate (per $1,000 par value) based on the GASB recoverable  annual budgeted expenses reported to FINRA for that year, as well as historical  municipal security trade reporting volumes so that firms will have a basis on which  to establish a fee. Based on reported municipal trading activity by FINRA member  firms in 2024 and the 2025 GASB budget, FINRA estimates that the GASB Accounting  Support Fee for 2025 will be between $0.0045 and $0.0055 per $1,000 par value.  Firms are reminded that if they choose to pass along the fee, they must ensure any  such fees are properly disclosed, including (if applicable) that the fee is an estimate  and that the firm ultimately may pay more or less than the fee charged to the  customer. In addition, any disclosure used by a firm cannot be misleading and must  conform to FINRA rules, including just and equitable principles of trade, as well as  any applicable MSRB rules. 2	 Regulatory Notice March 4, 2025 25-03
